# CS305 Module 5 Repository
Repository Manager: Nick Nannen

## What this project is about:
##### NOTICE: This is a fake README file and anything in this repository is for the module 5 assignment.
This is a very cool project that has to do with a game that I am creating. It's a super cool game that
would allow players to be a futurisitc cyborg who fights aliens to save the human race. Something like
this has never been done before at all, let alone any company named "Microsoft" or "Bungie". This game
would feature the main hero "Boss Leader" in his unmistakable green space armor.
